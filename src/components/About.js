                The main area of my expertise is front-end development with
                HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, building apps and responsive websites
                from scratch, and implementing the code in CMS. I make websites
                with knowledge of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines and HTML
                architecture to make web content more accessible.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have experience building websites with Python using Django and
                Flask and designing with tools such as Adobe Photoshop,
                Illustrator, XD, and Figma.
